This is a unique riff on the “Pinch” machine that the British experimented with in the very early days of nuclear fusion research (cir. 1948-50). The kinetic acceleration of the mirrored plasma is the unique part before using the magnetic pulse to compress the plasma in the final step. Also, their approach of trying to harness the excess magnetic energy to turn a generator is very unique as well. Hopefully the additional energy they will need to do their D - H3 reaction won’t be an insurmountable scaling problem. All I can say is good luck, hope they can make it work.

This looks very promising, considering how jaded I am with these private projects, this looks too promising. That said the CEO seems like he knows his sh*t though, has some PhDs in hard science and engineering so it may not be vaporware. It got funding from NASA years back and published peer-review studies of its operation and got independent auditors to check the legitimacy so it seems it has some firm ground with further development. Even with all that, gotta remain cautious

I really enjoyed the documentary. I retired from Helion in July of 2021, now I can show my family what I did for a living. I worked on FRC plasma machines for 35 years altogether. It’s good to see all the hard work come to fruition at Helion. My one disappointment with the footage is you didn’t show much of the puff fill system. That was my big contribution. I imagine I’m the only one that would get a thrill from a bunch of valves and stainless steel tubing.

I like the step away from using fusion as a way to generate heat to boil water to make steam to run a mechanical turbine. That alone is great but the overall design is great to see. And the fuelling of it too lots of forward about the fuel itself. It will be exciting to see future progress.

Not only does this video teach and inspire the next generation of engineerings as per the channel's goals; but it also gives everyone watching, engineers of all ages and fields, hope for the future. By far my favorite video to date and there are a LOT of good ones. This really had me thinking I should go back to studing my PHYS 122 material for my final this Monday. That is the magic that you have created. Well done.

Using this idea of pulsed fusion, I imagine an implementation with a radial type topology with 3 pairs of accelerators and a single fusion chamber, totaling 6 accelerators, which would fire in opposite pairs to produce the collision of each plasma ring, thus In this way, shots would be produced in pairs in a synchronized manner towards the same camera, for example in a rotary synchronization, similar to an axial motor, giving a longer reset time to each group of electromagnets.

Did you run the numbers on this? Like what's the theoretical maximum energy you could get from this design accounting for all the losses in the system, what's the practical amount you could get given costs and other challenges, and how close are they really?

An absolutely incredible deep dive, and an excellent job breaking down some very high science into a digestible and entertaining video. I didn't understand the first clip of glass being heated on a torch until it was repeated towards the end of the video, where it was mentioned that the speed of light has to be accounted for in the timing of commands. Definitely going to have to watch it a second time, before checking out the interviews on Nebula.
